### Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [issue],
to make sure work isn't being doubled up, and that it has the green light from me to be worked on.

From there, fork the repository into your own account and make the changes there. I _think_ you should
just be able to commit and push changes and have it deploy to your own github hosted site
(defaulting to _yourusername_.github.io, I believe.) You can check your changes there as you go,
and submit a pull request when it's ready to go live. The [just-the-docs-template README] gives more
information about how the build works with GitHub Pages and the Actions workflow. If you need any
help feel free to reach out.
