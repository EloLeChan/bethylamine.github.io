# Beth's Anti-Transphobia Library

This is the repository for the static webpage hosted at https://bethylamine.github.io/, my anti-transphobia library.

The purpose of this website is to catalog, archive, and in any way aid in making useful sources available and accessible to everyone who is responding to, debunking or otherwise engaging with transphobia online.

This website uses [Jekyll] and the [Just the Docs] theme, built and published on [GitHub Pages].

[Just the Docs]: https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/
[GitHub Pages]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages
