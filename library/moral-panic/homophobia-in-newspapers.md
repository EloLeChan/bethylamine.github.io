# Recycled Homophobia

[A Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl/status/1100719714387484672) by [@ImplausibleGrrl](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl)
has a large collection of examples of how today's transphobia recycles homophobia from the past. I have replicated it here, [with permission](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl/status/1644621713617854464)
so that it may be easily accessible, searchable, etc.
