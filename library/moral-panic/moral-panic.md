# Moral Panic

> A moral panic is a widespread feeling of fear, often an irrational one, that some evil person or thing threatens the
values, interests, or well-being of a community or society. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic).)

A large portion of anti-trans rhetoric, especially by conservatives but also now being piggybacked by gender critical
activists, is in the form of inciting moral panic. This has clear parallels with homophobia of recent history.
