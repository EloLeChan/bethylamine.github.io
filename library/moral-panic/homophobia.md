# Recycled Homophobia

[A Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl/status/1100719714387484672) by [@ImplausibleGrrl](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl)
has a large collection of examples of how today's transphobia recycles homophobia from the past.
I have sourced the newspaper clippings from there [with permission](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl/status/1644621713617854464).

The table gives examples of mirrored transphobic and homophobic fearmongering.

    > I have been taken back by something I saw while delivering my university ID card to receive a towel. It was not mildew
    > on the carpet or tile. It was not wet toilet paper all over the toilet seats. It was not a "something," but rather a someone.

    > The person who took my card and gave me a towel has been one with alternative thinking. You're right, I am making
    > assumptions. Let me tell you what those assumptions are and what went through my head:
    > 1) A high voice. Usually men have a pretty characteristic low voice. There are a few men, however, who don't have a low voice.
    > That is fine. "This guy must be one of those few and far between with a higher tone" I thought...but wait...
    > 2) Fingernails painted purple. Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, but the last time I saw a guy paint his fingernails
    > was in the first grade for Halloween and I would venture to say that something is wrong with this picture.
    > 3) An earring in the right ear. I don't think I have just fallen off the cantaloupe truck, but as far as I know,
    > the earring in the right ear can be a pretty good indication of sexual preference: alternative.

    > I view myself as a pretty understanding person. However, when I feel my rights are violated, I like to speak out. So here is my two bits' worth.

    > I have a very hard time seeing why someone with an alternative preference lifestyle would be put in a job in the 
    > same sex locker room. There have got to be other jobs around the sports complex that such a person can do where
