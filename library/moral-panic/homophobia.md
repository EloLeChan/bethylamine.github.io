# Recycled Homophobia

[A Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl/status/1100719714387484672) by [@ImplausibleGrrl](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl)
has a large collection of examples of how today's transphobia recycles homophobia from the past.
I have sourced the newspaper clippings from there [with permission](https://twitter.com/ImplausibleGrrl/status/1644621713617854464).

The table gives examples of mirrored transphobic and homophobic fearmongering.

Work in progress
