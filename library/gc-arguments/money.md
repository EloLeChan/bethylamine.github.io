# John Money

The argument often goes like this[^1][^2] (and there are many more[^4])

> The concept of "gender identity" was created by child abuser and pedophile John Money.
> From the beginning, the gender agenda has been to prey on children.

This argument moralizes the science around gender identity by pointing to the fact that a
prominent sexologist in the '60s had theories about gender and sex. Formally, this is called
the [genetic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy) and would be like saying
gravity is a bad theory because Isaac Newton was racist.

## More key facts
* There have been over fifty years of research since Dr. Money's incorrect theories. His unethical behavior
  in conducting surgery on infants and his theories on gender are not longer accepted in the medical and
  psychological community.
* Many historical examples exist to show the existence of trans people _decades or centuries_ before Money's work[^4].
* Dr. Money's controversial work in the 1960's does not invalidate the idea of gender identity.
  He popularized the term, as well as the term "sexual orientation" (in place of "sexual preference".)[^3]
* Dr. Money's experiment disproved aspects of his own belief (that gender identity is malleable). His theories of
  are closer to those who think that people can change their gender identity[^4].
* Gender identity and sexual orientation existed before Dr. Money popularized those terms.
* There is no evidence that Dr. Money coined the term "gender identity"[^4].
* He also takes credit for replacing the term "perversion" with "paraphilia", but nobody seems to be discrediting
  that word on this basis[^4].
