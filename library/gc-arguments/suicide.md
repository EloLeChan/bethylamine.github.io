# Suicide rates

## TODO

See also the facts about [Gender-affirming care](/library/sources/gender-affirming-care).

See also the misrepresented [Swedish study](/library/gc-arguments/the-swedish-study/) that is commonly used
as the source of increased suicide rates after gender-affirming surgery.

See also the [Suicide](/library/whatisawomanbot/threads/suicide) thread page for more facts and information.
