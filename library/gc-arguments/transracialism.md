# Trans-racialism

Often posed as a hypothetical to argue by contradiction by comparing being transgender to being trans-racial
(identifying as a different race), trans-age (identifying as a different age) or trans-species (identifying
as a different species or animal.) Some examples given are Rachel Dolezal and Oli London.

In short, gender identity is personal to the individual who has that identity (it is not inherited) whereas
race is also defined by culture and ancestry.

## The difference between categories

This pre-supposes that gender, race, age and species are all objective and factual classifiers that must all
be self-identified or none must be self-identified. However, these classification systems are not all the same.
This may also be a form of [essentialism](/library/gc-arguments/essentialism) that insists that people of different
genders or races are entirely separate, mutually exclusive, "things".

Gender and race are complex sociological parts of our identity. Neither gender[^4] nor race[^3] is based on biology.
This doesn't mean they're not real. However, they are primarily _social_ constructs. Transgender identity has
been widely studied, validated and been incorporated into guidelines for medical and healthcare organizations[^5].
Transracial identities have caused considerable controversy[^6] due to the fact that as a construct, race
is largely based on your parents and the culture and place you grew up in.

Age and species are also constructs, but have more objective definitions: the years since birth, and a
taxonomic classification.

## More information

Gender, race[^1], age and species are all at least partly socially constructed, that is, they are labels that people
put on top of real phenomena in order to help understand, categorize, or judge things. But not all constructs
are equal: because their definitions vary (see [Social construct](/library/definitions/social-construct/).)

They can also be more or less fluid in how their definitions change over time based on updated understanding,
and so on. In the case of race, the move away from being primarily defined by biology (as was the case with
[scientific racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism)) happened in the later half of the 20th
century. Race is generally self-identified, and is generally expected to be a combination of one's ancestry,
culture, and physical qualities. It can also be fluid. The perception of one's racial identity can shift
with experience and time[^2].
