# Claim: "phobia" implies fear

This one is often heard as "I'm not scared of transgender people" with relation to the word transphobia. However, like _homophobia_,
_transphobia_ means more than just a fear, it also refers to a dislike or strong prejudice against transgender people. For more
information on what transphobia is and how it's defined, with examples, see the definition of [transphobia](/library/definitions/transphobia).
