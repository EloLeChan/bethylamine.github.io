# Trans Rights

An often asked question is "What rights don't trans people have?" in response to anyone who speaks up for
trans rights or says "Trans rights are human rights."

This question oversimplifies the complex issue of human rights into a binary of having a right or not having
a right. However, the fight for trans rights includes much more than just legal rights. It includes the fight
for recognition, social acceptance, and protection from discrimination and violence, both on an individual
and systemic level[^2]. Furthermore, the question minimizes the varied experiences of trans individuals across
different countries and legal systems, ignoring the diverse and nuanced nature of the struggle for trans
rights[^1]. It is also very disingenous because while feminists still fight for women's rights today[^4], even
in developed nations, such as the right to abortion[^5] (which as of writing on April 16, 2023, is currently
banned in 13 states in the U.S.), sexual violence[^6] in Chile, and the Chinese government's population
policies that subject women to forced abortions or forced pregnancies[^7], the same people asking "What rights
do trans people lack?" are not also asking "What rights do women lack?"

Here are some of the avenues of trans rights that are being fought for:

1. **Legal Recognition and Protection**<br>
   Transgender individuals often face difficulties when it comes to legal recognition of their gender identity.
   According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA), only 96 countries
   worldwide have accessible processes for legal gender recognition, and crucially, only 25 are described as not
   having "prohibitive requirements"[^1]. Even in countries where the process exists for legal gender recognition,
   this process is often under attack by virulent anti-trans rights campaigns firmly opposed to introducing a system
   of self-declaration, such as in the United Kingdom[^1], where the system for some legal processes can also be
   virtually inaccessible due to lack of access. One such citizen of the United Kingdom e-mailed her national
   healthcare provider 133 times trying to get a doctor's appointment[^3]. The lack of legal recognition, whether
   by criminalization or by indefinitely delay, can lead to issues related to personal identification, accessing
   services, and social acceptance.
