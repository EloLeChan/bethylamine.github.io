# Trans Rights

An often asked question is "What rights don't trans people have?" in response to anyone who speaks up for
trans rights or says "Trans rights are human rights."

This question oversimplifies the complex issue of human rights into a binary of having a right or not having
a right. However, the fight for trans rights includes much more than just legal rights. It includes the fight
for recognition, social acceptance, and protection from discrimination and violence, both on an individual
and systemic level[^2]. Furthermore, the question minimizes the varied experiences of trans individuals across
different countries and legal systems, ignoring the diverse and nuanced nature of the struggle for trans
rights[^1]. It is also very disingenous because while feminists still fight for women's rights today[^4], even
in developed nations, such as the right to abortion[^5] (which as of writing on April 16, 2023, is currently
banned in 13 states in the U.S.), sexual violence[^6] in Chile, and the Chinese government's population
policies that subject women to forced abortions or forced pregnancies[^7], the same people asking "What rights
do trans people lack?" are not also asking "What rights do women lack?"

Here are some of the avenues of trans rights that are being fought for:

1. **Legal Recognition and Protection**<br>
   Transgender individuals often face difficulties when it comes to legal recognition of their gender identity.
   According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA), only 96 countries
   worldwide have accessible processes for legal gender recognition, and crucially, only 25 are described as not
   having "prohibitive requirements"[^1]. Even in countries where the process exists for legal gender recognition,
   this process is often under attack by virulent anti-trans rights campaigns firmly opposed to introducing a system
   of self-declaration, such as in the United Kingdom[^1], where the system for some legal processes can also be
   virtually inaccessible due to lack of access. One such citizen of the United Kingdom e-mailed her national
   healthcare provider 133 times trying to get a doctor's appointment[^3]. The lack of legal recognition, whether
   by criminalization or by indefinitely delay, can lead to issues related to personal identification, accessing
   services, and social acceptance.
2. **Access to Healthcare**<br>
  Transgender people frequently face barriers in accessing appropriate and affirming healthcare. A report by the
  National Center for Transgender Equality found that 33% of respondents who sought healthcare experienced mistreatment,
  and 23% did not seek healthcare due to fear of being mistreated[^8]. Transgender people deserve equal access to
  healthcare services, including gender-affirming care, without discrimination or prejudice.
3. **Protection from Discrimination and Violence**<br>
   Transgender people fave high rates of violence, including physical attacks, sexual assault, and intimate partner
   violence. National U.S. surveys find that nearly one in ten (9%) of respondents reported that they were physically
   attacked in the past year because of being transgender.
   
   Nearly half (47%) of respondents have been sexually assaulted as some point in their lifetime, with one in ten
   (10%) respondents reporting being sexually assaulted in the past year. Nearly one-quarter (24%) experienced
   severe physical violence by a current or former partner, compared with 18% of the U.S. population[^8].

   Transgender individuals are disproportionately affected by discrimination and violence. According to a report
   by the Human Rights Campaign, the rate of fatal violence against transgender people in the United States is
   higher than the general population, with transgender women of color being particularly vulnerable[^9].
4. **Education and Inclusion**<br>
   Transgender students often face discrimination and exclusion in educational settings. A GLAAD study found
   that 75% of transgender students felt unsafe at school, and 59% were denied access to restrooms consistent
   with their gender identity[^10]. More than three-quarters (77%) of those who were out or perceived as
   transgender had one or more negative experiences at school because they were transgender, such as being
   verbally harassed or physically attacked[^16]. The trans rights movement seeks to create inclusive and affirming
   educational environments for transgender students, ensuring equal access to education and opportunities for
   success.
5. **Employment and Economic Equity**<br>
   Transgender individuals often face discrimination in the workplace, which can lead to higher rates of
   unemployment and poverty. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported that 80% of respondents who held a job
   in the past year reported either experiencing some form of discrimination and/or taking steps to avoid
   discrimination at work (by hiding their past gender transition, for example.)[^8]
6. **Public Accommodations and Services**<br>
   Access to public spaces and services is another area where transgender people face challenges. Discriminatory
   policies and practices can restrict transgender individuals from using facilities, such as restrooms[^11] and
   locker rooms[^12], that correspond with their gender identity. The trans rights movement calls for the development
   of inclusive policies and the removal of discriminatory practices in public spaces, ensuring that transgender
   individuals can access public accommodations and services without fear of harassment or discrimination.
7. **Family and Parental Rights**<br>
   Family and parental rights can't be taken for granted by trans people. In 2020, transgender man Freddy McConnell
   lost the legal battle to register as his child's father and the Court of Appeal also ruled against McConnell,
   upholding the previous decision[^13].
8. **Representation in Media and Culture**<br>
   Transgender individuals are often underrepresented, misrepresented, or negatively portrayed in media and
   popular culture. This lack of accurate representation can perpetuate stereotypes, contribute to stigmatization,
   and negatively impact public perception. While visibility through media has increased, likely due to an increase
   in the raw population of individuals who identify openly as transg and gender diverse, mediated portrayals are
   often stigmatizing, are played by cisgender actors, and/or pigeonholed into transnormative boxes[^14].
9. **Mental Health and Well-Being**
   Transgender individuals are at an increased risk of experiencing mental health challenges due to societal
   stigma, discrimination, and marginalization. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 40% of respondents
   reported attempting suicide in their lifetime, which is nearly nine times the national average[^15].
   The trans rights movement emphasizes the importance of mental health support and access to appropriate mental
   health care for transgender individuals, as well as working to reduce the social factors that contribute to
   mental health disparities.
