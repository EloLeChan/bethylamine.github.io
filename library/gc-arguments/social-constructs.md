# Claim: Social constructs are meaningless or "aren't real"

One persistent assumption that is made in gender-critical arguments is the
notion that social constructs are meaningless, less important than natural
sciences, or otherwise dismissable.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember, activists are using the existence of the white box below in order to argue that the blue and pink areas are meaningless &quot;social constructs&quot; with no basis in biological reality. <a href="https://t.co/7LfbGyyoUI">pic.twitter.com/7LfbGyyoUI</a></p>&mdash; Colin Wright (@SwipeWright) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwipeWright/status/1532790745177923584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Social constructs are not meaningless and can often have profound impacts on
our lives. For example, money, marriage, ownership, geopolitical divisions,
and indeed race, gender, and sanity.
