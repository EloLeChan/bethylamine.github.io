# It's unscientific
TODO

## Summary
This argument uses the notion of "science" very loosely, in a way that is more closely related to the public image of science than to any legitimate scientific research.
The belief that gender identity is "unscientific" stems from any of the following misconceptions:
- A scientific theory that used to be accepted (because it was well-supported with the time's existing works and means of research) was and will always remain factual, and cannot later be proven incorrect or incomplete, even with further research.
- There exists a hierarchy to sciences, because only physically observable phenomena are real, and anything that isn't tangible might as well be made-up : sociology and psychology are less "real" than biology. Similarly, gender identity is seen as intangible and unobservable; "not real".
- Gender identity is "a mental disorder", and denying that implies a denial of scientific works in psychiatry. 
- Semantic confusions between the notions of gender and sex, therefore assuming that the only "legitimate" science that can research gender identity is biology.
- Attachement to the simplified, binary notion of biology taught in most standard school curricula.

## Breakdown
### When does a theory become a fact, and can facts change?

### Are some sciences more real than others?

### Semantics: Confusion between gender and sex
The confusion around the words "men" and "women", "male" and "female", and which way they are used in what context, is the centre point of many gender-critical discussions. "Men can't be women!" is repeated over and over, and dictionary entries are used as arguments against the validity of gender identity (see: Adult Human Female[^1]).

In actuality, these terms (man, woman, male, female) have been used both to talk about the notions of biological sex and gender identity, hence the confusion. Neither is technically incorrect. Semantics tend to be less rigid than they are assumed to be; a dictionary only aims to census definitions for words. The way a word, however new or old, is used, is what causes the entry ; the entry does not change the way the word is used, or make that usage less legitimate. Language evolves with its speakers use, which isn't determined by scientific research, but rather by people's general understanding and navigation of the world around them.

For clarity's sake, the following is a more detailed explanation of the differences between gender and sex. Keep in mind that some of this language is highly medicalised in nature, and although it aims to reflect the different aspects of gender accurately, it shouldn't be used to define someone's gender experience as less valid than another.

**Sex** 

**Gender identity** 

**Gender presentation**

**Gender incongruence**

**Gender dysphoria**

### Is gender identity real, and is it observable?


### Is gender identity a disorder?
Some people misunderstand mental disorders as anything that falls outside of the scope of "average" cognitive experience. Something that is different is seen as "abnormal" and needs to be studied and potentially erased, regardless of whether or not it poses a legitimate health risk or represents an impairment for the individual. This viewpoint is also present for physical health; in the context of intersex individuals, some of which undergo surgery as infants so that their genitalia may fit the medical norm for binary sex, even if such surgeries may cause mental and physical health issues in the future that would otherwise have been absent[^4].

In most entries from the DSM-IV onwards, criteria for diagnosis is that "symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment [in functioning]"[^6][^5] (fulfilling normal everyday activities: showering, making food, socialising...). The point of diagnosing something as a disorder from an ethical standpoint is to be able to provide adequate treatment when needed. In the DSM-IV, gender dysphoria was present under the entry "gender identity disorder". This was changed to "gender dysphoria" with the release of the DSM-V in 2013, after criticism related to the stigma associated with the word "disorder".
