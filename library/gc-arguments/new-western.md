> - "Where do non-binary people come from?"
> - "Dunno."
> - "It all starts in Mesopotamia."
> - "When was that?"
> - "2000 B.C."
> - "2000 B.C.?"
> - "This civilization was the earliest records of humanity. There are references to types of people
     who are neither male or female, and the records describe how God created these people, their
     roles in society, and words for different kinds of them. The same time, let's skip over to
     Ancient Egypt, shall we? Who also described three genders: male, female, and sekhet. Let's spin
     the globe one more time, shall we? and we'll go to Southern Asia."
> - "Is this around the same sort of time?"
> - "This is actually a little bit later, this was around 400 B.C. There are the earliest records of
     the Hijra people. The Hijra can consider themselves to be neither male or female."
> - "As a whole entire civilization?"
> - "Yeah. And they still exist, the Hijra people, although oppressed, they are. Next we have seventh
     century B.C. These are my favorites. The Scythians, who were Eurasian nomadic horse riders who

     various kinds of genders that all fall under the umbrella of Two Spirit, which just encompasses
     the different kinds of genders that they had in the communities that don't fit in the Western
     gender binary. Now, post-Christ, first century, the year 100. There are records stating that
     classical Judaism actually recognized six genders. I can't tell you more information about that
     because I don't know it. Anglo-Saxon, when did they start recognizing non-binary people? The
     roots of you and I. The British. Because in the 11th century, there was a word found called 
     wÃ¦pen-wifestre, which meant woman with a weapon, which also people believed to be a woman with
     a penis and may have been a word used to describe queer, intersex, non-binary folk, back in
     the 11th century of Britain."
 > - "So it's not a new thing at all."
 > - "It's ancient. It's ancient, baby. It goes as far back in time as we know."
