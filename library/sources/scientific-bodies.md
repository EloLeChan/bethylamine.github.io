## Extended list

The following is a non-exhaustive list of scientific bodies that support transgender people.

1. **American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry**[^1]<br>
    > Gender-affirming care is not child abuse. Variations in gender expression are not
    > pathological; rather, they represent normal dimensions of human development[^2]
    
1. **American Academy of Dermatology**<br>
    Founded in 1938 with more than 20,500 physicians worldwide[^3].
    * Recognizes that transgender and gender diverse individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical 
      gender-affirming treatments.
    * Supports evidence-based coverage of all gender-affirming therapy and procedures which help the mental and
      physical well-being of gender diverse individuals.
    * Recognizes that gender-affirming procedures and treatments are not “cosmetic” or “elective” or for the mere 
      convenience of the patient. These procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be 
      medically necessary for the health and well-being of the individual.
    * Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage of 
      gender transition treatment.
1. **American Academy of Family Physicians**<br>
    Founded in 1947, represents 136,700 physicians and medical students across the U.S.[^4]
    > We recognize health as a basic human right for every person, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.
    > For gender-diverse individuals, including children and adolescents, this means access to gender-affirming care
    > that is part of comprehensive primary care.
1. **American Academy of Nursing**<br>
    The Academy's more than 2,800 fellows are nursing's most accomplished leaders in policy, research,
    administration, practice, and academia[^5].
    > The American Academy of Nursing supports initiatives to address the health needs of transgender individuals
    > (TI) and supports policy initiatives that reduce the heath care barriers that most TI encounter.
    
    The AAN opposed the repeal of transgender-specific protections under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act
    noting: "The proposed rule would eliminate the definition of sex discrimination from the Section 1557 regulation, 
    inviting insurers to deny treatment to transgender and gender nonconforming patients, including the denial of 
    treatments such as hormone therapy, counseling and surgery that are essential to transgender patients, as they 
    see fit. ... Since the implementation of Section 1557, 18 states have implemented affirmative coverage protocols 
    in their respective Medicaid programs to ensure coverage of medically necessary transition-related care. These 
    coverage improvements and any future progress will be in jeopardy if this rule is finalized as proposed."
1. **American Academy of Pediatrics**<br>

      of Veterans Affairs' refusal to engage in rulemaking to reconsider its ban on providing transgender-related
      surgery to veterans.
    * Opposes discrimination in health care and insurance coverage based on an individual’s sexual orientation
      or gender identity.

1. **National Commission on Correctional Health Care**<br>
    The mission of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care is to improve the quality of health care in
    jails, prisons and juvenile confinement facilities[^27].
    
    > "Because jails, prisons, and juvenile confinement facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and
    > mental health and well-being of inmates in their custody, correctional health staff should manage transgender 
    > patients in a manner that respects their biomedical and psychological needs. The National Commission on 
    > Correctional Health Care recommends that the following principles guide correctional health professionals in 
    > addressing the needs of transgender patients:
    > 
    > 1. Because transgender patients may be under different stages of care prior to incarceration, there should be no 
    >    blanket administrative or other policies that restrict specific medical treatments. Policies that make
    >    treatments available only to those who received them prior to incarceration or that limit transition and/or
    >    maintenance are inappropriate and out of step with medical standards and should be avoided.
    > 2. Accepted treatments for gender dysphoria should be made available to people with gender dysphoria. Providing
    >    mental health care, while necessary, is not sufficient. ...
    > 3. When determined to be medically necessary for a particular patient, hormone therapy should be initiated and 
    >    regular laboratory monitoring should be conducted according to community medical standards.
    > 4. Sex reassignment surgery should be considered on a case-by-case basis and provided when determined to be 
    >    medically necessary for a patient."

    > established as the standard of care. Federal and private insurers should cover such interventions as prescribed 
    > by a physician as well as the appropriate medical screenings that are recommended for all body tissues that a 
    > person may have.

    * SAHM opposed the repeal of transgender-specific protections under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act,
      noting "The proposal would also eliminate the provision that prohibits a health plan from categorically or automatically excluding or limiting coverage for health services related to gender transition".
1. **World Medical Association**<br>
    The World Medical Association (WMA) is an international organization representing physicians. The organization 
    was created to ensure the independence of physicians, and to work for the highest possible standards of ethical 
    behavior and care by physicians, at all times. Membership consists of 114 National Medical Associations[^30].
    
    The WMA recommends, among other things, the following:

    > 1. "The WMA emphasises that everyone has the right to determine one’s own gender and recognises the diversity 
    >    of possibilities in this respect. The WMA calls for physicians to uphold each individual’s right to 
    >    self-identification with regards to gender.
    > 2. The WMA asserts that gender incongruence is not in itself a mental disorder; however it can lead to 
    >    discomfort or distress, which is referred to as gender dysphoria (DSM-5).
    > 3. The WMA affirms that, in general, any health-related procedure or treatment related to an individual’s 
    >    transgender status, e.g. surgical interventions, hormone therapy or psychotherapy, requires the freely given 
    >    informed and explicit consent of the patient.
    > 4. The WMA urges that every effort be made to make individualised, multi-professional, interdisciplinary and 
    >    affordable transgender healthcare (including speech therapy, hormonal treatment, surgical interventions and 
    >    mental healthcare) available to all people who experience gender incongruence in order to reduce or to 
    >    prevent pronounced gender dysphoria."
1. **World Professional Association for Transgender Health**<br>
    The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) is an international, interdisciplinary, 
    professional association devoted to the understanding and treatment of individuals with Gender Dysphoria (GD). 
    Founded in 1979, and currently with over 1500 medical, mental health, social scientist, and legal professional 
    members, all of whom are engaged in clinical practice and/or research that affects the lives of transgender and 
    transsexual people, WPATH is the oldest professional association in the world that continuously has been 
    concerned with this clinical specialty[^31].
    
    > The WPATH Board of Directors urges health insurance carriers and healthcare providers in the United States to 
    > eliminate transgender or transsexual exclusions from their policy documents and medical guidelines, and to 
    > provide coverage for transgender patients; also to include in their policy documents and medical guidelines the 
    > medically prescribed sex reassignment or gender affirming/confirming services necessary for subscribers’ 
    > treatment and well-being; and to ensure that ongoing healthcare, both routine and specialized, is readily 
    > accessible and affordable to all their subscribers on an equal basis.
