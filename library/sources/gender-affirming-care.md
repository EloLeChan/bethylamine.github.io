# Gender-affirming care

#### Terms
GAHT
: Gender-affirming hormone therapy

VTE
: Venous thromboembolism (blood clots)

* Gender-affirming care reduced depression by 60% and suicidality by 73% of trans adolescents in just one year[^1].
* The longest study involving trans and nonbinary youth showed reduction in depression and anxiety.[^2]
* Gender affirmation is linked to improved mental health. There's no evidence it drives youth suicide.[^3]
* Social interventions have been found to lower the rates of depression and anxiety in trans and nonbinary
children[^4].
* Long-term data suggests that gender-affirming hormone therapy has no negative effect on bone[^5][^6].
* Youth on puberty blockers overwhelmingly chose to start gender-affirming hormones[^6].
* Current limited evidence suggest that transgender women taking GAHT have increased risks of ischemic stroke and VTE,
  with the incidence rate (per year) increasing from 0.07% to 0.13% and 0.07% to 0.32%, respectively, compared to cisgender men,
  and these risk factors should be adequately managed[^7].
* A review of 27 studies involving almost 8,000 teens and adults who had transgender surgeries, mostly in
  Europe, the U.S. and Canada, found that on average 1% expressed regret.[^8] Another study of 1,989
  individuals found that 6 patients (0.3%) requested reversal surgery during the course of 14 months[^9].
