-- Benjanun Sriduangkaew, 2014[^18], 10 years ago. The patterns of abuse still persist.

## Foreword: Why am I writing this?

It has come to my attention that [Benjanun Sriduangkaew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjanun_Sriduangkaew) (henceforth shortened to BS, or Bee), is at
the center of intra-community fights and the link through which I came to be harassed and involved in the situation,
and the people that follow, protect, and brigade together, has a long and storied history of manipulation, lying,
serial harassment, blackmail and abuse. She often uses DARVO to accuse victims of the very things she's doing to them,
including of using DARVO tactics[^38].

It seems like every few years, people rediscover what a horrible person Bee is. The internet forgets quickly.
So here's my contribution.

## TL/DR

Here's my summary. Sources are more thoroughly listed below the TL/DR section, don't take my
word for it. I encourage you to see and make up your mind for yourself, and I have linked both sides of this controversy where applicable.
I am not trying to convince anyone of anything but just presenting what I've found (which will, of course, include my own biases, I'm not saying it doesn't.)

* Benjanun is a Thai multi-millionaire (heiress to a hotel empire) cis lesbian science fiction writer and serial abuser who uses social justice language to strongarm people into shutting up,
  accusing them of being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc., when she is not allowed to abuse people recklessly, in some cases for her own career gain.
* She treats many trans masc people with derision.
* Any attempt to call this out is branded "transmisogynistic", in the same way GCs brand trans activism as "anti-woman", regardless
  of what your beliefs actually are. They see anyone who calls them out as siding with their enemy.
* This has been going on since before 2012, and despite apologies, this pattern of behavior persists.
* Most of the controversy that is documented about Benjanun is in the 2014-2017 year range, regarding her effect on the SFF
  community. Most of this is in the past, and I don't feel the need to re-litigate the past when there is enough happening
  in the present.
* Roughly 8 investigations (not including follow-ups) by unique individuals have been published about her patterns of abuse since 2012.
* Neither of the two investigations I found[^6][^16] defending Benjanun excuse her behavior, but are routinely used as
  a weapon to silence dissent, as if those investigations completely debunk what she has said and done. They don't, and
  instead they try to defend things like "Are you an amoeba? [...] It's a regurgitation done without skill" as "not an attack",
  but rather just "strongly worded criticism", and disapproval of "flay him alive slowly [...] pour acid, dismember and keep him alive as long as possible"
  as "policing how POC should express their criticism of racism".
  * However, this doesn't stop her followers calling allegations against her "spurious", "unfounded", and "straight-up lies".
* Benjanun *has* received abuse. This part is not surprising, but it is also used to seed FUD about where she stands.
  Receiving abuse does not make you not abusive, or make your abuse justifiable.
* These are often played off as jokes, a classic gaslighting tactic "Yes, she makes lots of 'kill whitey' jokes"[^6]
* Today, Benjanun expresses cis- and trans-man hating rhetoric, with the latter category being doubly insulted by being
  explicitly reductive about the axes of oppression that trans men face.
* While Benjanun may not be using as vitriolic language today as publicly as she had in the past, her patterns of abuse are still
  the same.
* Benjanun and followers claim any and all criticism to be "an organized hate campaign". I had no idea who she was until
  I started looking into it and writing this.
* There are definitely similarities between what happens surrounding Benjanun on Twitter that feels very familiar to GC
  brigading and TERF in-grouping- lovebombing, sealioning, incredible bad faith in service of optics, degrading and abusive
  rhetoric, and I understand why, despite obstensibly supporting trans women, her attitudes outside of what she deems
  worthy is very TERFy.
* Her followers will accuse you of lying or being bad faith, and block you when you present any form of evidence[^43] (while 
  haranguing their not-yet-blocked victims for not responding to their every demand[^44].)
* She often participates in proxy wars, and boosts her followers who do the antagonizing for her (assailants.)
* Her followers will use her purported "uplifting of trans women" (who agree with her particular ideology) as evidence
  that she can't be transphobic.
* They will feign that "nobody is taking transmisogyny seriously" when "shit blows up"[^48].
* Do not believe any accusations she or her cult make without verification. They have a very out of touch idea of what
  constitutes things like harassment, bigotry, abuse, etc.
* I feel for all victims of abuse and manipulation. This shouldn't happen.

**Do not harass or abuse anyone mentioned. This fuels the fire. And it is my opinion that nobody is an
"acceptable target" of harassment or abuse. Take back power by shrinking their sphere of influence. Block, ignore, and pass this on.**

### Context, my involvement

**If you're not interested in how I got involved, you can skip this whole section.**

On April 8th, 2024, [@autotheurgy](https://twitter.com/autotheurgy) tagged me in a
[thread](https://x.com/autotheurgy/status/1777452553782939672) saying that my add-on (Soupcan) is being
manipulated because @benjanun_s was marked as red. ([Screenshot](../assets/img/benjanun-report/callista_thread_1.png))

I had pretty much (only in passing) never heard or interacted with her before. I gave her the benefit of the doubt when a Soupcan user
expressed disapproval with her mark, and removed it, at one point in the past.

My first response to the accusation that my platform was being manipulated or gamed was to check
the reports on this user, to check for fake reports / unverifiable claims, botting, hacking,
and so on. There were a few reports that I saw, with 4 different tweet examples linked. It appeared
that these were genuine grievances. So, I [responded](https://twitter.com/bethylamine/status/1777459133404582159)
by saying they were not gamed, and [asking what made them illegitimate](https://twitter.com/bethylamine/status/1777459582740373620).
([Screenshot](../assets/img/benjanun-report/callista_thread_2.png))

Callista's response was to block me, and I [called her out on it](https://twitter.com/bethylamine/status/1777460442283290975).
([Screenshot](../assets/img/benjanun-report/beth_response_to_being_blocked.png))
I was snarky, sure. Someone had just told me something I built was effectively trash and didn't want to explain why. But
my reaction was blown way out of proportion to the point of victim blaming[^41].

([Screenshot](../assets/img/benjanun-report/beth_response_to_being_blocked.png))

After this point, I started to receive a fair amount of backlash and abuse. You can decide for yourself whether this
is a measured response, or dogpiling/bad faith criticism. Here's a selection:

* "ur fuckin trash lmao" - @baedellyy ([link](https://x.com/baedellyy/status/1777588664790392970))
* "Good faith, entirely honest. Fuck you." - @EmRoseDeLeon ([link](https://x.com/EmRoseDeLeon/status/1777931774552936892))
* "Beth hun. [..] Good luck with healing. May you find clarity. [...] Girl what the fuck actually??? How did you think this wouldnt get flak?" - DM
* "Girl how are you being this obtuse? [...] you think you're being abused right now? Get some perspective" - @EllisPritchard2 ([link](https://x.com/EllisPritchard2/status/1778089594430345445))
* "It's crazy you have time on your break to respond [...] yet you haven't responded to [...] debunking" - @estralena ([link](https://x.com/estralena/status/1778130338390135022))
* "Fuck me that extension is hot garbage" - @pacifistycuffs ([link](https://x.com/pacifistycuffs/status/1778116786786795858))
* "Not responding [...] totally doesn't come across as JAQ'ing off" - @StrategiaSE ([link](https://x.com/StrategiaSE/status/1777650744994288025))
* "I told her how shit of an idea this was [...]" - @autotheurgy ([link](https://x.com/autotheurgy/status/1777587279692759213))
* "why don't you just go work for anduril or something it feels like you'd be a good fit" - @shipsposting ([link](https://x.com/shipsposting/status/1778128813697732619))
* "trying to performatively wash your hands of how this app is being used in real time is horrifying. You're not in the community with trans fems, clearly." - @SomniumImmanis ([link](https://x.com/SomniumImmanis/status/1778124276123816279))
* "your little tool participates in transmisogyny [...] good job!" - @RoboTranssexual ([link](https://x.com/RoboTranssexual/status/1777646224767603124))
* "Did you bother to check the context [...] or did you just go [...] guess this person deserves to die?" - @SomniumImmanis ([link](https://x.com/SomniumImmanis/status/1778126757440504175))
* "you built the birthday botnet [...] go cry me a fucking river" - @shipsposting ([link](https://x.com/shipsposting/status/1778128029522199004))
* "do your fuckin job or shut your garbage down and walk away" - @SomniumImmanis ([link](https://x.com/SomniumImmanis/status/1778127056678920414))
* "please get rid of your brigading tool. just obliterate it. [...] your tool is poison" - @rozietoez ([link](https://x.com/rozietoez/status/1778125091555180819))
* "Soft boy g*mergate tool." - @benjanun_s ([link](https://x.com/benjanun_s/status/1777577087559463262))
* "this quisling thinks the obviously spurious reports for her community harassment tool are actually legit [...] apparently (X) is of a much higher severity than (Y). fuck you Beth." - @shipsposting ([link](https://x.com/shipsposting/status/1778116264633696419))
* "just granting endless credulity to nonsense from transmisogynistic bad faith actors" - @rozietoez ([link](https://x.com/rozietoez/status/1777465887517483274))

(You can see more [here](../assets/img/benjanun-report/selection_of_responses.png), and on Twitter.)

Keep in mind that this was all arose out of my not unquestioningly reversing a red mark on Soupcan. Which, had
I decided to go in and make changes *only* because people pressured me into doing so, that ironically *would* be platform
manipulation.

### About Soupcan
Soupcan is a browser extension that highlights users that have been reported for transphobia. Users make reports and
give reasoning, typically linking a tweet as an example, or multiple tweets. Reports are weighted based on how much
trust a user has built up in the system, which is why a bunch of new accounts who signed up on April 8th were not
able to successfully appeal Benjanun's label. The database updates generally every 24h. Red marks are frequently
appealed due to not enough evidence or mistakes being made. From experience, at least 95% of the red marks that I
see are deserved. Most reports are approved automatically and are not vetted by moderators, because there are
thousands of reports and we are all volunteers.

Soupcan, above all, is community based. This will never be perfect. There are guidelines to ensure people are on
the same page. But the alternative to this is to designate a transphobia "judge", which IMO, is worse. The tool then
just becomes a megaphone for that one person's opinions, rather than something that represents the community overall.

It is a tool to help people curate their feed on Twitter, not a tool to harass or brigade people. In the entire time
I've seen people using Soupcan, I have not once seen anyone use Soupcan to attack someone. If you read through this
whole report, you can add a Soupcan emoji to your tweet so I know you did. Just as Wikipedia is not
a source, but it can provide sources as references, Soupcan collates reports, which people can use to make up their
minds. Calling a red mark enabling "social murder"[^50] is wildly exaggerated in service of protecting Benjanun's image.

As you can see from above, the mark against BS was framed as a personal failure on my part, rather than the system
working as intended, albeit in a way they disagreed with. That said, I have planned many improvements to it and still
take constructive feedback on board.

You can read more about it and how it works on the website, [here](https://soupcan.beth.lgbt/).

# Who is Benjanun Sriduangkaew (BS)?

* She is a cis[^21] lesbian[^22] Thai-Chinese science fiction / fantasy (SFF) writer[^11]. 
* She has been known under the aliases Winterfox[^3][^20], Requires Only That You Hate (ROTYH)/Requires Hate (RH)[^3][^20][^28][^34], acrackedmoon[^1][^20][^34], pyrofennec[^1][^16][^20][^34], Valse de Lune[^20][^34], Lesifoere[^17][^20], and Maria Ying[^9] (as a joint pseudonum with Devi Lacroix.)
* "Benjanun Sriduangkaew" is likely another constructed identity.[^1][^17]
* She was revealed to be a multi-millionaire heiress of a hotel empire.[^17][^13][^14]
* Since at least 2009[^46], she has been infamous for:
  * castigating any dissenters with accusations of bigotry[^5] 
  * directing threats of rape and assault at various people, particularly women, *especially* queer women and women of color[^20]
  * shutting down discussing by directing personal attacks, harassing commenters who liked books she didn't, making racist comments to various minority members. Her hatred lead to the death of the community dedicated to reading and discussing the works of authors of color[^20]
  * drive one woman to attempt suicide[^24], which some of her fans mocked
  * harassed a rape victim for at least six months in 2013[^20]
  * decade-long history of spewing violent, homophobic, transphobic, racist and sexist hate speech under sockpuppet accounts[^32]
  * showing no intent to change[^33].
* She issued two apologies in 2014.[^18][^19]
* BS's racist, sexist, classist behavior up until that point has been compiled in multiple places, from multiple victims and multiple reporters.[^26][^1]
* Many people have come forward as victims of her actions or to corroborate BS's pattern of harassment.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^25][^26][^27][^30][^31][^33]
  The breadth of this and time periods clearly show that this is *not* a "co-ordinated attack" on BS.

## Tropes and patterns

### "Birthday boy"

Birthday boy is obstensibly a meme about someone provoking someone else and then acting too harmless to be taken seriously,[^33]
a crybully for transmisogyny. 

It's a reference to [this tweet](../assets/img/benjanun-report/birthday-boy.png) which describes a "5'8 guy
who'd taunt every jacked, 6'3 bro he men until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up, whereupon [he] would go "heyheyheyyy
c'maahn I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guyy, no, it's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boyy" and it somehow
always worked" and has stuck as a pejorative for a kind of trans man they are against. The term has been around since at
least August 2023[^58].

BS (and friends) have made many snide remarks about how "birthday boy" cannot be harmful, because it's merely a funny little joke.
* [Example 1](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-1.png)
* [Example 2](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-2.png)
* [Example 3](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-3.png)
* [Example 4](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-4.png)
* [Example 5](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-5.png)
* [Example 6](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-6.png)
* [Example 7](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-7.png)

*She has always been like this.* 10 years ago, when told "It's a personal insult to call the author a 'stupid fuck'",
her response was "oh no, not personal insults to persons not present. what horror, paging Internet Nannies." as well as
"how do you cope with the internet or real life".[^6]

This is classic dog-whistle behavior of gaslighting victims into believing they're overreacting, but it's clear from
her usage, and how her followers understand her usage, that this label is used to deride and other, putting them into
a group of people who are immediately bad faith misogynists- anyone who is a man, and thus an acceptable target due to
their 'inherent privilege' ([example](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-misandry.png)) including of trans masc / trans men
(intersectionality has left the chat.)

Despite the surface reading of "birthday boy" to mean a particular type of behavior, it's usage shows that it paints a
broad brush over communities of people, in usages such as "bday boy central", "birthday brigade", or 'birthday twitter'

Examples of using variants of "birthday boy" to deride and other:
* [Example 1](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u1.png)
* [Example 2](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u2.png)
* [Example 3](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u3.png)
* [Example 4](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u6.png)
* [Example 5](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u7.png)
* [Example 6](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u8.png)
* [Example 7](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u9.png)
* [Example 8](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u10.png)
* [Example 9](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u11.png)
* [Example 10](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u12.png)
* [Example 11](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u13.png)
* and more, but I got bored finding examples, given that this was just the *last month*

It's also just used as a general pejorative ([ex. 1](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u4.png) and [ex. 2](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u5.png).)

Her, and many of her followers, reduce intersectionality (in this case, where experiences that cis men and trans men have differ) to 'misandry doesn't exist' to justify their hatred.
* [Example 1](../assets/img/benjanun-report/misandry-1.png)

### Usage of anti-trans masc pejoratives / slurs

These examples are from people in the community and not from BS herself. They are included here
to show the kind of transphobia that exists where she goes. She is not responsible
for what other people say. 

**"Zippertits"**

A pejorative that transphobes use to describe trans men, in reference to top surgery scars; a graphic description of post-surgical scarring
used to evoke mutilation and disgust. Examples of transphobes using this include:

* [Example 1](https://x.com/AthrexEntity/status/1780179067372794278)[^51]
* [Example 2](https://x.com/MalokK97861047/status/1780565871724753155)[^52]
* [Example 3](https://x.com/challah_bread_/status/1780043715274293433)[^53]

and endorsement by BS:
* [Example 1](../assets/img/benjanun-report/bb-u14.png)[^54]

**Other cases of transphobia**

* There are multiple cases of accounts Benjanun follows[^57] that use 'troon' and variants unironically.[^55][^56]
* "XX behavior"[^59]

## Attacks and impacts

This will be summarized from the Mixon report[^1].

Her attacks predate the social-justice driven figleaf she uses as a weapon. Her track record makes it clear
that her progressive rhetoric is a means to an end. If her target is white, they're a white supremacist. Or, if
they don't identify their race, they're accused of "white women's tears" (She said this to a Cambodian-American woman[^1][^20].)
If they're a POC, they aren't racially 'pure' enough. Many of the given evidences are anecdotal, but there are
a significant and independent swathe of stories. Here are some recent examples.

* [Example 1a](../assets/img/benjanun-report/racism-1.png) / [Example 1b](../assets/img/benjanun-report/racism-2.png)
* [Example 2](../assets/img/benjanun-report/misogyny-1.png)
* [Example 3](../assets/img/benjanun-report/misogyny-2.png)

1. BS will pursue someone to target (often someone who speaks ill of her or her behavior)
2. She will post bitter and abusive posts, death threats.
3. She will then erase the most violent and abusive comments leaving no visible proof that the threat occurred.
  * Not many screencaps of her worst abuses exist, but there are recovered screencaps, now-deleted content via the Wayback Machine,
    and independent emails from both targets and witnesses confirming the substance of the death, rape, maiming, and
    dismemberment threats BS has been accused of.
4. Both writers and readers have been driven away from the field due to the toxicity they've experienced or witnessed. (Anecdotal.)
5. Here are some examples of the threats she's made.
   * "If I see [redacted] being beaten in the street, I'll stop to cheer on the attackers and pour some gasoline on him." -
     "[redacted] is an ignorant, appropriative bag of feces."
   * "Spread the word that [redacted] is a raging racist fuck. Let him be hurt, let him bleed, pound him into the fucking ground. No mercy."
   * "Stupid fuck" -- "Homophobe" -- "without any talent whatsoever." "Your liking for this pile of verbal diarrhea proves what morons fantas fans are."
   * "rape apologist!" -- "her hands should be cut off so she can never write another Asian character."
   * "ah, if only I could actually do it in person. with scalpels, not words."
6. These repeated attacks have had chilling effects on online communities. Victims become fearful of speaking up,
   even mildly, against her or in favor of whatever she attacks. They prefer to leave and remain silent.
   * "Having seen that 'throw acid on them' is a threat for uppity folk not only in my parents' home country but in SFF fandom certainly put me off a career in writing fantasy."
   * "She made me afraid to talk about books--books, for crying out loud--because she disliked them and I would be branded a shitstain and worse for
     disagreeing. She made me feel unsafe in certain communities including those that were created to support people like me.
     She made me reluctant to express support for certain authors of color."
7. BS has cultivated a sizable cast of followers her respond to her calls to help launch attacks. BS public positions herself
   as the victim and accuses her target of doing what she in fact has just done to them, and asks her followers to go on the attack.
8. Her tighter circle is drawn in with lovebombing and threats of becoming targets themselves should they defect.
9. Her defenders gaslight their victims into thinking they're not *really* being abused.
10. FUD is spread about the accusations and criticisms against her, saying they're outright lies and bad faith, so the cycle continues.

## Defenses of BS

* "the real fuel for Mixon’s blog post is the ire of a group of white women who were enraged"[^16] / "relying on the words of powerful white people"[^6] / "this is about silencing and isolating Bee as punishment for calling out white women on racism"[^16]
  * Attributing malice and motive does not preclude the ability for us to see what was said.
  * I'm not going to argue this one way or the other, but given BS' history of wielding accusations of racism as a silencing tactic,
    and the fact that many affected were not white, I don't give this argument much credit.
  * none of this "enraged white women ire" is ever surfaced, because their comments are extremely tepid in the face of BS' unhinged remarks about maggots and being dismembered.
  * Neither is there any evidence that this is about silencing someone. This is a post hoc justification which is clear from the focus of the reports on her abuse, not her commentary about race.
* "the Mixon report is a Gish Gallop / Document dump"[^6][^16]
  * The irony of making this accusation at the start of a 140+ page rebuttal[^6] is not lost on me
  * The report was sufficiently large to cover the accusations in enough detail and no more. It cannot be a [Gish Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)
    because that applies to the format of formal debate: not giving your opponent time to respond to half-truths; an exploitation of
    [Brandolini's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law). Clearly, her defenders have had sufficient time to address the document.
* "there is plausible deniability in some of the accusations of the things she's done"[^16]
  * There is too big a laundry list of examples of her abuses and a trail of independent victims that warrant no further plausible deniability.
* "she is not engaging in DARVO"[^16]
  * Her behavior is almost a textbook example of it. 
    * Deny: she gaslights victims into thinking she's not doing what she's doing (it's just a joke! it's just strong language!)[^39]
    * Attack: when confronted with evidence, BS attacks that person as being "part of an organized campaign of hatred" against her.[^40]
    * Reverse Victim and Offender: BS reinforces that she is the true victim, and has her minions come to her defense (read: dogpile her victim.)
* "Bee was criticized for speaking up about the attacks against her"[^16]
  * The source for this was two randoms talking on twitter with no external traction.
* "it's untrue that one of her targets was goaded into a suicide attempt"[^6][^16]
  * The source for this is that the exchange that was pointed to as the trigger is deemed "civil, albeit rather blunt, and certainly [not an attack]."
  * The exchange shown doesn't show goading, but it is not up to a third party to invalidate what can or can't cause someone's suicidal ideation.
  * RH herself replies in an apology "I was shocked to learn that I triggered you into a suicidal downswing. Intent doesn't matter--nor does it excuse--but I'm genuinely sorry that I caused to this"
* "the dog rape threat is bunk"[^16]
  * The reasoning for this, given in a Tumblr blog post[^34], is that they don't believe her, because Bee used different handles on every platform.
  * And they didn't specify an exact time, but rather "not all that long ago".
  * So therefore, it seems more likely that this was an imposter.
  * I understand it's hard to procure evidence that you *didn't* say something, but this reasoning clearly shows a bias
    towards believing Bee when the evidence is ambiguous.
* "Mixon's analysis of Bee's victims is statistically invalid. Dunning-Kruger incompetence."[^16]
  * Mixon argues that Bee's targets are disproportionately POC, and uses an unvalidated assumption that the rates of publications of POC authors are roughly comparable between children's book writers and SFF writers.
  * This is a valid criticism. However, that doesn't mean it's wrong. Notably, the American book industry is still overwhelmingly white.
    As of 2015, white/caucasian industry respondents represented 79%[^35] - notably higher than the 60% in the racial breakdown presented
    in the Mixon report. I don't see this as a strong argument either way, though.
* "the abuse she has received is worse than the abuse she has given" (multiple places, such as "There's some references to Bee apparently having asked people about their ethnicity [...] but nobody says anything when Victor Ocampo publicly questions Bee's identity")[^6][^16]
  * Does not excuse her behavior, and the author mentions as such in the disclaimer at the top, too.
  * Victor questions the validity of a nomination for diversity if BS can't be verified as POC. This is different to
    haranguing people on the basis of their supposed race.
* "yes, she's deleted things, but it was due to stalker-related issues"[^16]
  * That doesn't explain the pattern of immediately deleting the worst of her abusive posts shortly after they've done what they needed to.
  * This explains, perhaps, shutting down entire accounts, removing personal information, and so on. But "deleted things" wasn't
    really the accusation. It was: "After an attack, she deletes her most inflammatory posts and accounts and departs,
    leaving her targets reeling and others who come later scratching their heads, unable to
    find evidence and wondering what all the fuss was about."[^1]
* "her behavior was something she's specifically apologized for"[^16]
  * There are just as many if not more cases where she has not apologized to her victims. An apology also means less
    and less each time you continue to engage in that behavior.
* "there's no way she can make the pain she did cause go away"[^16]
  * This is an unfair reading of what was being said.
  * The operative words used were "addressing the damage she has done, much less undoing it"[^1].
  * "Undoing", on a fair reading, does not imply rewriting the past. It means making amends and reconciliations--owning up to what you did and making it right.
    * If you trashed someone's house and you were asked to "undo the damage", it would be understood that you would clean it up,
      not that you were being asked to make the house never trashed to begin with.
* "Bee cannot make amends if she is silenced and ostracized"[^16]
  * She is actively posting on Twitter, and hasn't suffered any loss of exposure or income to the best of my knowledge.
  * Someone may be ostractized, but that is no excuse for them to not *attempt* to make amends.
* "Myth: RH used multiple pseudonyms to hide her actions"[^6]
  * The author argues that, "it was actually literally impossible for anyone to know of RH,
    pyrofennec, acrackedmoon and Winterfox, and not know that they were the same person."
    * It is not *literally impossible*, because it in fact *literally happened*. Multiple times.
* "Myth: RH targeted PoC women, homosexuals, and disabled people"[^6]
  * The author rests on the semantics of "targets" and "attacks", suggesting that the evidence is hearsay.
  * There are first-hand accounts from WoC of the abuse they suffered, you can decide for yourself.
    * Not a fun post to write, by Rachel Manija Brown[^2] who was raised in India[^]
    * other examples here including Cindy Pon, an Asian-American woman, and a Central Asian woman[^20]
* "Myth: RH is the leader of a cult, manipulating her followers to do her evil bidding"[^6]
  * The author dismisses this as a product of Mixon's imagination, because there is "no evidence that anyone ever did anything they did not want",
    and that "I'd like to know who Mixon things BS is holding [...] hostage and under her 'control'."
  * She manipulates her followers with DARVO, who go to war on her behalf, believing they are 'fighting the good fight'.
    The patterns of abuse that stem from interacting with that clique
    would seem to indicate that there is a culture of dogpiling that is allowed if not endorsed. If you read through this
    whole report, you can add a Soupcan emoji to your tweet so I know you did. There are many high-profile
    twitter users with extensive friend groups who do *not* incite dogpiles, so it's not fair to say that "The 'community'
    she created was far from a cult, and there is no indication that the friends she made are any different than anyone else's friends."
* "Mixon's report was motivated by loathing"[^6]
  * Whether or not this is true has no bearing on the evidence provided.
* "BS's reports were not attacks, but rather just negative reviews"[^6]
  * [Example 1](../assets/img/benjanun-report/nuke.png). Édouard argues that this is a "thinking woman's 'nuke it from orbit'", which is
    *amazingly* incredulous. This is a snarky and over-the-top teardown, making accusations of internalized misogyny,
    internalized racism, creepy romance, a fleshed out rapist character, bad writing, and dubious gender politics. It is
    *not* a considered or measured response. It is not even a review. It very explicitly calls for (metaphorically) a
    'biochemical weapon to Cindy Pon's coordinates'. Any well-adjusted person would consider this vociferous rebuke an attack.
  * "she hoped to enjoy [it] because she shared Pon's gender and, to some extent, part of her racial identity. This could also
    explain why RH reacted with so much negativity to the racism and sexism she perceived in Pon's books."[^6]
    * Doesn't excuse the attack, so I'm not sure why this is relevant.
* "We are left to conclude that to Mixon, critiquing racism in a piece of fiction in a way that cannot be refuted,
   worse, that the author can appreciate the truth of the criticism, and strive to improve her work in the future
  in order to better represent characters of color in her works, is wrong. Frankly, that explanation is not really
  satisfying and I think it’s false."
  * That the author decided to see a silver lining and take feedback does not mean there wasn't an attack.
    * "Are you an amoeba? [...] It's a regurgitation done without skill, with an extra does of racism" is what author Édouard
      is defending. His words are, "I file this case as not an “attack”."
* "This type of biased perception of what is acceptable behaviour, i.e. that strongly worded criticism of racism and colonialism 
  is somehow worse than the racism and colonialism expressed in the first place, is common among my people"
  * I don't believe there is evidence to support this claim. Firstly, "strongly worded" underplays BS's invective.
    Secondly, I don't think anyone had a problem with suggestions of checking for potential bigotry, but rather the
    shutting-down and chilling effect that BS's words had.
  * Édouard writes this off as "RH acting as an activist to improve the representation of PoC in SFF", conflating what is
    uncontroversially good (diversity) with what is being pushed back on (abusive rhetoric.)
  * However, there does appear to be a line, where "exaggerating for rhetorical effect, and interpreting these statements as
    literal death threats is stupid and disingenuous" is crossed for the author, and he does concede that "RH is then guilty of
    using hyper violent language for rhetorical effect on her personal blog and quite possibly twitter in order to illustrate
    to level to which she found Bacigalupi’s book offensive. [This is] objectionable conduct."
* "Here is how I interpret things so far. RH reads a book and is offended by some of the content. She writes a review using, for her, rather mild language."[^6]
  * BS herself admits that it is not her intention but the effect that matters, and has said it was "inexcusable"[^18].
* "Mixon is targeting RH."[^6]
  * In the literal sense, yes. RH is being targeted to shine a spotlight on her abuses.
  * The author uses the fact that "Mixon's essay had [...] coordinated release and publicity", "she published at least 2 follow-up posts",
    "discussed RH multiple times on twitter", and draws comparisons between Mixon asking for signal-boosting to that of RH "cultivating a
    sizeable cast of followers who respond to her calls to help launch attacks".
    * This is not a fair comparison, as Mixon is not asking anyone to defend her or attack RH, but rather draw more attention to her
      expose.
  * The author continues to make comparisons to liken Mixon's actions to RH's actions: "Apparently, it’s not what RH was allegedly doing that what wrong,
    because Mixon and her associtates[sic] are involved in the exact same behaviours. It’s who she was."
    * This serves no purpose but to suggest that the two are equally bad. Even if this is the case, that would still mean
      that RH's behavior is bad.
* "BS is reformed."[^6] "[it's] disingenuous to refer to something she has repeatedly apologized for because it 
  shows that you aren't really after accountability but rather that you want her to stop supporting trans women
  who talk about transmisogyny"[^42]
  * The following years, including to this very day, show otherwise.


For the reasons above, [^6] appears to give way more benefit of the doubt than what I would consider reasonable for the average person.

[^16] relies a lot on an appeal to incredulity, rather than evidence / [reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum), i.e. "This is so ridiculous, it can't be true."
  * "for the above to have any meaning *at all*, it requires attributing *enormous* power to a single reviewer, allowing them to exert far-reaching influence over huge swathes of the publishing industry."
  * "to believe that it *is* true would require that Bee have some sort of superhuman understanding of psyychology and specific person's triggers."
  * "Read those exchanges. If you can figure out how they could have *possibly* been "goading"[sic] into a suicide attempt, I'd love to hear it."

## Conclusion

The harassment I received based on a red mark in Soupcan is a proxy war against who they consider the enemy, 'birthday boys'.
It had very little to do with the Soupcan application itself, and I know this because many of the users seemingly didn't even
know how Soupcan worked or had ever used it before, before forming a biased opinion of what it does/what it means/how it works,
and then attacking me for it.

**Benjanun's actions in supporting and endorsing comments about trans men using terms like "zippertits" and "cuntboys" is
sufficient to label these actions transphobic. In addition to this, promulgating a pejorative dog whistle for trans men that paints
that demographic as intrinsically worthy of derision is also transphobic bigotry. It is a dog whistle because it is argued
that there is plausible deniability in that it is "just a joke", despite what the evidence and usages of the term reveals.
For these reasons, the reports on Benjanun in Soupcan will remain, but will be marked as "Controversial", because a large
enough community of trans people do feel supported by her.**

Nobody, including BS, deserves hatred, abuse, or bigotry. I am firmly against that. However, that does not
excuse, explain, justify BS's actions or make them irrelevant. I have not gone into thoroughly researching attacks
*against* BS, because they are, frankly, not relevant to the claims of her behavior. Nor am I interested in the motives behind the people writing
reports about (for/against) BS, because I care about the claims, being made, not who wrote them or why, or how they
decided to word it, or if they show bias or not.

It doesn't change anything I've written here.

Abusive manipulators shouldn't be given the fuel they crave to harass and harangue. Block them, and pass this on.
