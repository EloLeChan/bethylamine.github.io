# Social construct

> A social construct is a concept or category that has socially and culturally
> mediated meaning. In other words, social constructs are concepts that
> generate their meaning through social and cultural worldviews.[^1]

Many things that can, at a glance, seem objective, fall under this category. 
Within a specific time frame and culture, the meaning of a particular social
construct may seem *relatively* static. For example, what is fashionable, and
indeed what is *beautiful* has changed over time, and varies by culture and
location. Beauty is therefore not objective, but socially constructed in a
specific time period[^1].

Indeed, race is also a social construct. While there are biological features
that factor into the construct such as skin pigmentation and other biological
markers, the cultural associations we ascribe to race make it a social 
construct[^1]. This is an important point to make, because social constructs
often relate to things in the material world, whether that be skin color
(in case of race) or the size and shape of a person's body (in case of
ideal beauty.) The fact that social constructs are, well, socially constructed
does not mean that they are wholly abstract concepts that don't relate to
the material world.

In this same way, gender is also a social construct. For more information about
this, see the [gender](/library/definitions/gender.md) and [sex](/library/definitions/sex.md) definition pages.
