# Gender Critical (GC)

"Gender Critical" is a euphemism for anti-trans. The name comes from designating "gender"/"gender ideology" as the notion that
gender identity is a valid part of someone's identity, beyond biological sex, that can be different to one's assigned gender
at birth and can be self-determined. This is the core philosophy of transphobia. Also known as TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical
feminists) which originally referred to a group of radical feminists that began to splinter from the radical feminist movement
and excluded trans women from their feminism. See: [TERF](/library/definitions/terf/).

The gender critical ideology denies that transgender identity is real and seeks to eradicate it from society. Many gender critical
ideologies identify themselves as feminists and believe themselves to be protecting women from men; they accuse transgender women
of being male predators in disguise, and transgender men of being self-hating women[^1].

Not all transphobes fall under the label 'gender critical', but all who fall under the label 'gender critical' are transphobes.
