# TERF

TERF stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist.

Here is notable gender-critical ideologue J.K. Rowling wishing a fan a "Merry Terfmas":

## Is it a slur?

Certainly, TERF (like ‘cis’) is often used in angry commentaries online by
both cis and trans feminists, either as an accusation (e.g. ‘you’re a TERF’) or an
insult (e.g. ‘fuck off TERF’). Yet, it is important to understand and account for the
power dynamic at play here. In examples such as those above, members of a
marginalised group and their allies seek to identify, and express anger or frustration at,
a harmful ideology that is promoted primarily by and in the interests of those
who are systemically privileged as cis (men as well as women). That is not to say
that this is a helpful process without qualification. For example, a well-meaning
but poorly-informed individual may be unfairly labelled a ‘TERF’ due to their lack
of awareness or understanding of the realities of trans lives. This does not,
however, mean that ‘TERF’ actually functions as a slur. Christopher Davis and Elin
McCready (2020), for example, have argued that while the acronym can be used to
denigrate a particular group, this group is defined by chosen ideology rather than an
intrinsic property (in contrast to trans people for instance, or women). It is this
denigration of a group defined by an intrinsic property that is necessary to constitute a
slur. Moreover, in the case of ‘TERF’ the act of denigration does not function to
subordinate within some structure of power relations (in contrast to acts such as
misgendering, and sexist slurs such as ‘bitch’)[^1].

## History of the term

### The ontological question

In the mid-1960s, around the time that the term ‘transgender’ was beginning to appear in
medical discourses (Williams, 2014f), groups of feminists especially in Anglophone and
European contexts began excluding certain women from feminist spaces. During this
period, the excluded women in the 1960s were principally lesbians, as being a lesbian
was considered akin to being an un-woman: someone who had left ‘the Territory of
Womanhood altogether’ (Koedt, 1973, p. 247). This created a constituency of feminists
split in two: authenticated women who enjoyed visibility and inclusion within feminist
spaces, and deauthenticated women who endured shunning and had to fight for their

inclusion. This type of constituency-policing would later significantly affect transgender
women, and thus offers important context for the history of deauthentication, dehumani-
zation, and violence directed at trans women.

In 1970, in response to their exclusion, some lesbians began promoting a notion of
‘woman’ that could be inclusive of their experiences, describing a ‘women-identified
woman’ as one who obtained ‘her internal sense of self’ from ‘ideals of nurturing, com-
munity, and cooperation that she defined as female’ (Gianoulis, 2015) because she was

not ‘considered a “real woman”’ (Radicalesbians, 1970). Reflecting upon the exclusion
of lesbians in feminist spaces, Rita Mae Brown, a member of both the Radicalesbians
and Furies Collective, framed the experience thusly: ‘those [feminist] women, most of
whom were rather privileged and very bright, treated lesbians the way men treated them
. . . [Betty Friedan] tossed me out and said that I was the Lavender Menace’ (Makers,
2012). The deauthentication of lesbian women’s experiences of selfhood to compel them
to assume a social context not representative of their truths, experience, or class realities
was and is an enfeebled attempt to grasp at empowerment through a form of lateral vio-
lence; an animus directed against one’s peers rather than one’s oppressors. Such empow-
erment strategies have been disruptive and destructive to constituencies of women.[^2]
