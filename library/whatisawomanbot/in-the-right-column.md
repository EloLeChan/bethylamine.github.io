# Response to @TheRightColumn's thread

Thread unroll: <https://twitter-thread.com/t/1640837014265163777> ([archived version]())

## Summary

In short, @TheRightColumn's argument rests on the presupposition that the only definitions
that are valid are [essentialist](/library/gc-arguments/essentialism/) ones[^8]. This is
short-sighted[^10] when it comes to discussing sociological issues like the nature of the
class of people we call 'women': the definition is a fluid culturally-constructed
amalgamation of traits and characteristics of which none are essential. Essentialist
thinking lies at the core of many reductive, discriminatory and extremist ideologies,
and is correlated with racial prejudice[^2].

@TheRightColumn then brazenly characterizes criticism of these misunderstandings as
accusations and dodges[^9], without realizing that their whole argument relying on
essentialism is a direct and valid criticism of the underpinning presupposition.

## Extended response

@TheRightColumn claims that users of @WhatIsAWomanBot are flailing at the question
"What is a woman?" and hiding behind the bot. The bot's purpose is to provide a robust
and thorough response to the question and the context behind asking the question. This
has nothing to do with the user's ability to answer the question themselves, which is
part of the childish goading ("You're not answering because you can't!") that is touched
upon in the response. Because this question is so often asked in good faith, it makes
sense to automate it.

@TheRightColumn then goes on to explain how categories work and pre-supposes that "woman"
is an expression of a "physical, biological reality" (something the bot explicitly
challenges, and that has only really come into the fore since the 18th century[^12][^13])
He argues that because one such definition of trans women "anyone who
identifies as a woman" is circular, the logic behind a cohesive definition of trans
women is invalid[^6]. This subtly invokes the nature of
[essentialism](/library/gc-arguments/essentialism/), which is the belief that all "things"
including human-made categories such as male and female, _must inherently_ have some set
of properties or characteristics that in and of themselves make that thing a member of
that category, without which they are _not_ a member of that category. As explained more
in the definition of [social construct](/library/definitions/social-construct/), social
constructs generate their meaning through social and cultural worldviews - this directly
means that the definition of women (a social construct) is not dictated by any one person
or any one definition, but by the collective understanding of the traits and characteristics
that women have. It is also worth noting that the definitions of social constructs change
over time and vary by culture.

@TheRightColumn then goes on to state that @WhatIsAWomanBot argues that there is no
such thing as female[^5]. It is the same argument - by pointing to the dictionary definitions
of male and female as "having a gender identity that is the opposite of _other gender identity_"
he claims that it has no inherent meaning[^4]. This is incorrect for the same reasons above.
The definition of the male and female gender identity is socially constructed and not
objectively measurable---just like race (n.b. this does not mean it isn't real.)

@WhatIsAWomanBot claims there isn't a definitive answer to the question asking it to
"List the specific traits that make a gender identity uniquely female, and the different
specific traits that make a gender identity uniquely male." @TheRightColumn takes this
to mean that this means "there is no answer to how males and females differ."[^3] Again, this
is pre-supposing an essentialist definition of male and female.

@TheRightColumn then makes a critical misunderstanding of @WhatIsAWomanBot's explanation
of gender. Gender is a larger concept that encompasses roles, behaviors, activities and
attributes---gender identity is the internal representation of one's place in relation to
gender. @TheRightColumn says, "the idea that men & women are just social roles is nonsense"
when referring to gender as a broader, society-wide concept, but then claims @WhatIsAWomanBot
denies the existence of those roles as it explains that _gender identity_ (not gender as a
whole) is based only on the person who has that gender identity[^7].
