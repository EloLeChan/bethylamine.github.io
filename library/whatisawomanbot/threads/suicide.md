# Suicide

### <https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot/status/1634801971688505349>

#### Summary
Trans people are at more risk of suicidality due to mental health stressors such as legal barriers,
discrimination, lack of acceptance, harassment and assault, fear of transitioning (e.g. losing a life partner)
and gender dysphoria. Gender affirming care is shown to reduce that risk dramatically. Using a high suicide rate
for a minority group as an attack on said group is incorrect (as the blame is not with them) and alarmingly lacking in compassion.

#### First, a persistent myth...

MYTH: Suicide rates increase post-op / only increase with gender affirmation. This is a misrepresentation of the so-called
"Swedish study", which you can read more about here: <https://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm>

In actual fact, transgender people who had received one or more gender-affirming surgical procedures had a 42%
reduction in the odds of experiencing past-month psychological distress, a 35% reduction in the odds of past-year
tobacco smoking, and a 44% reduction in the odds of past-year suicidal ideation[^4].

#### What are the facts?

1 in 3 trans youth attempted suicide in the past year[^1] and report more than 4x greater rates of suicide
attempts compared with their cisgender peers, including those who are LGBQ[^3].

Among LGBT people, trans people are 2x more likely to think about and attempt suicide[^1].

But access to gender-affirming hormone therapy LGBTQ youth who report having at least one accepting adult were
40% less likely to report a suicide attempt in the past year[^2].

Trans people are at risk of suicide because of factors that put strain on one's mental health, such as[^1]:

* Institutional prejudice, like laws and policies which create inequalities and/or fail to provide protection from discrimination.
* Experience of discrimination (transphobia) in the form of physical or verbal harassment, physical or sexual assault.
* Lack of support from parents and other family members.
* Stress related to fear of transitioning, including potential backlash and life disruption, as well as considering the risks and sometimes length time period involved.
* Gender dysphoria, or distress related to the conflict between one's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify.

The rates of suicidality are drastically reduced through[^1]:

* Supportive and strong relationships with family and friends
* Completed medical transition (if desired)
* Self-awareness and acceptance
* Access to gender affirming health care
* Not having access to lethal means such as guns or potentially deadly medications
* Having one's name and pronouns accepted
