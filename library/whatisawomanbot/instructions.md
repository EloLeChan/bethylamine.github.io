# WhatIsAWomanBot Instructions

@WhatIsAWomanBot will jump into any thread where you tag it. If you tag it simply with `@WhatIsAWomanBot`, it will
reply with it's main thread, which responds to the question "What is a woman?" This can also be explictly invoked
with the `woman` keyword, as explained below.

Here's an example!

@WhatIsAWomanBot will also join in conversations where you mention it. It will respond to your message as well as
the previous messages in the thread.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you so much, <a href="https://twitter.com/19Outlaw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@19Outlaw</a>!
