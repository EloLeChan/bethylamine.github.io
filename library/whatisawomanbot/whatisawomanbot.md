# WhatIsAWomanBot

WhatIsAWomanBot is a Twitter bot created and operated by Beth ([@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine).) It is not currently
open-source[^1]. It is a cloud managed script that uses the Twitter API to control the [@WhatIsAWomanBot](https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot)
account, by replying to invocations via @ tagging and responses within conversations where the bot is tagged.

The list of keywords the bot will respond to is here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Keyword master thread! ðŸ§µ<br><br>To use these, please read my pinned thread for details.</p>&mdash; What Is A Woman Bot (@WhatIsAWomanBot) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot/status/1418525378407059458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

These keywords generate automated responses as a reply to the tweet it's invoked in. Other responses, to tweets replying to the bot, are
handled by ChatGPT via API call, and are suffixed with a computer emoji (ðŸ’»):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You&#39;re right, repeating something doesn&#39;t make it true, but neither does ignoring scientific evidence and the experiences of marginalized communities. Have a nice day. ðŸ’»</p>&mdash; What Is A Woman Bot (@WhatIsAWomanBot) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot/status/1643862945137573890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[^1]: For a few reasons. First, I need to fully consider all the potential for misuse. Second, the code is messy and needs a rewrite/refactor. Third, I'm lazy.
