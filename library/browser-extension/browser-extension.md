# Soupcan
{: .no_toc }

Soupcan is a browser extension that takes features built up by WhatIsAWomanBot and packages them into your browser.
It's currently in development, but you can start using it whenever you like by installing it from the [github repository](https://github.com/bethylamine/soupcan).

Right now, it shows trans-antagonistic Twitter accounts with red highlight. You can also send in reports of other accounts
and they will show up orange in your browser until the reports are approved and then it will show up red (requires you
to update your database manually at this point in time, which can be done by right-clicking anywhere on a Twitter page
that isn't a link and choosing Soupcan -> Update database.)

Soon, other features will be rolled in to improve QoL and to offer more trans-supportive features.
