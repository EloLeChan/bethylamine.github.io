# Soupcan
{: .no_toc }

Soupcan is a browser extension that takes features built up by WhatIsAWomanBot and packages them into your browser.
It's currently in development, but you can start using it whenever you like by installing it from the [github repository](https://github.com/bethylamine/soupcan).

## Installation instructions
Please follow the readme in the [github repository](https://github.com/bethylamine/soupcan). The extension is still in beta
and is not on any Extension store yet. Once you install it, you'll be greeted with a setup page. There are two steps in the
setup. First: sign in with Twitter. Second: download the database. The setup page will guide you through both.

## Rules for use
Please see the [Terms of Service](https://bethylamine.github.io/library/browser-extension/tos)

Additionally, if you're marked as a transphobe, or your account is too new, you won't be able to use the extension. If this
is an issue or you feel like you've been falsely marked please DM me on Twitter @bethylamine.

## Features

Right now, it shows trans-antagonistic Twitter accounts with red highlight. You can also send in reports of other accounts
and they will show up orange in your browser until the reports are approved and then it will show up red. You can also appeal
falsely-flagged accounts with the "Appeal" feature. You can access options via the extension icon > Options e.g.

And right now there is just one option, to mask media coming from transphobic accounts:

Soon, other features will be rolled in to improve QoL and to offer more trans-supportive features. Check out the github project
