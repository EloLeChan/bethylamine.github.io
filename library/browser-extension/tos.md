# Terms of Service
{: .no_toc }

By using Soupcan, you agree to the following rules:

1. Use the report feature only to report transphobes
  * General guidelines: if there is a pattern of misgendering trans people, calling trans a mental illness/delusion,
    using transphobic slurs (in a derogatory way) and otherwise show hostility or antagonism towards trans people specifically
  * Not worthy of a report by itself: people who are being mean to trans people, asking questions about trans people
    in potentially clunky language, accidental misgendering, one-off transphobic comments (must be a pattern)
  * Report: biotrans, comparing trans women to blackface, self-identified 'gender critical', 'terf' or 'transphobic'
  * Use discretion: take their overall account into consideration and do not report for having one bad take or belief
3. Use the appeal feature only to unmark users who are not transphobic
  * Users will sometimes be falsely flagged, check their profile to see if the reason is "TransphobeB", which tends to
    have more false flags. If the reason is "process ext:" it is also automatic and may be falsely flagged
5. You will not attempt to overload or in any other way interfere with the APIs or backend of the extension
  * do not try to hack or DOS the service

Failure to adhere to these rules may result in:

* verbal warning, and/or
* removal from the service
