# Moderation Guidelines
{: .no_toc }

This page is specifically for Soupcan Community moderators to follow as their own stricter/more stringent set of rules,
since they have more weight when it comes to making decisions for Soupcan markings, and it's more important to have
consistency among the moderation team. For this reason, a number of scenarios are listed below, categorized as
'Major signals', 'Minor signals', and 'Investigate signals'.

* Major signals are signs that by themselves are enough to mark a user red with no further requirement.
* Minor signals that form a pattern (3 occurrences) are enough to mark a user red.
  * You can use the search feature to find other examples
* Investigative signals may help to give context to minor signals, in that any 3 occurrences of them
  count as one minor signal, or provide more certainty to your judgment.

These rules are guidelines and human judgment is more important than following the exact guideline. This is just a way
to set a base level of understanding. When reporting, include the tweet URL of the most egregious example, or
multiple if there isn't one that stands out specifically / explain briefly why if more context is needed.

## Major signals
* Memes, graphics, or messages condoning trans suicide, genocide, or violence against trans people
* "Biotrans" / other 4chan psyops
* Harassing someone by misgendering **with intent of harm** (e.g. YWNBAW, etc.)
* Posting pre-transition pictures of someone without consent or with intent of harm
* Using slurs with intent of harm (some trans people use slurs, and that is **not** by itself cause for marking)
* Heavily supporting "LGB without TQ", "protect women's sports/spaces", etc. narratives
  * Retweets and likes alone are not enough, support needs to come from their own words
* Spreading fearmongering such as collages of "trans" criminals, portraying a negative message about the entire trans demographic
* 

## Minor signals
* GC colors, emojis, flags, slogans such as "Adult Human Female" in name or bio
* Retweeting/liking transphobic content (each instance counts as one occurrence)
* Trans ignorance by itself isn't transphobic:-
  * Espousing bioessentialism or a biological view of sex, or misgendering **without the intent of harm**
  * Believing that being transgender is a mental illness

## Investigative signals
* Following other red users (only counts once, not once per user)

## Exceptions
* Accounts dedicated to following/tracking transphobia
* News and other large aggregate accounts, unless they are systematically transphobic
  * Prefer reporting the journalist or writer of transphobic content instead
