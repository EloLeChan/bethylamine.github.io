# Privacy Policy
{: .no_toc }

## Short story:

* Soupcan does not track you on Twitter, read any tweets, or keep access to your account except to verify your identity.
* This includes the self-report functionality at <https://api.beth.lgbt/add/me> which you can use to add yourself to the
  redlist.

## Long story:

Because Elon's API pricing change means that you have to pay $100/month for anything other than a write-only and login-able
API, the Soupcan's usage of the Twitter API is limited to authenticating your user. This is despite it saying it can read
all your tweets and view users (these are just the scopes `tweet.read` and `user.read` which are required for getting your
user page.)

Your user ID (e.g. 1489387160885071873) and/or username (e.g. @bethylamine) may be stored in a backend database for
identification purposes, e.g. to validate who is making reports and the actions they are taking with the extension that
send data to the server.

All of this is publicly available information, and nothing is stored related to your username/ID except that which is
necessary to provide functionality for the service (reports, appeals, etc.)
