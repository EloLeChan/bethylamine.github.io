# Login failure
{: .no_toc }

You failed to authenticate with Twitter and therefore cannot use the extension at this time. This may be due to a number of factors:

* Your Twitter account is too new
* The Twitter login process failed
* You have been blocklisted from using this extension
* Maybe a bug in the code!

Please let me know by DM'ing me on Twitter: @bethylamine and I'll try to get it fixed.
